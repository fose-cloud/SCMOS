 * What the dashboard would say if it could talk.
 *
 * The front page had ten figures and no opinion. Half of them were zero or
 * "cannot be measured", and whoever opened it had to work out for themselves
 * which of the rest mattered this morning. This is the same numbers, read: a
 * short list of sentences, worst first, each one clickable through to the
 * screen that answers it.
 *
 * <b>Nothing here is written in the browser.</b> Every sentence arrives from
 * the API, where the rules that counted the figures already live — the monitor's
 * risk list, the problem list, the delay register. A second opinion assembled
 * here would eventually disagree with the screen it is summarising, which is
 * the shape of bug this codebase keeps finding.
 *
 * It loads after the board, and the board is complete without it. A briefing
 * that held the front page hostage would be worse than no briefing.
